# NyaWare

NyaWare is a computer virus for Windows.

## What does NyaWare do on computer?

NyaWare opens anime pictures in random moment and in random position on screen. You can't close these pictures XD. It also plays ahh sound very loudly (if you have 0% volume NyaWare will set it to 100% and play the sound). NyaWare adds itself to autostart and overwrites Master Boot Record. **WARNING: DON'T RUN THIS FILE ON YOUR COMPUTER!!! RUN IT ON VIRTUAL MACHINE ONLY!!! DON'T SEND IT TO ANYONE!!!
